                    <h3>IP address</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's a number given to a device using the IP protocol,
                        which serves as an identifier in the third (network)
                        layer of the OSI model. IP address can be assigned using
                        the Address Resolution Protocol used to associate IP
                        with MAC. It identifies the network interface of the
                        host and provides the location of the host in the
                        network, which means that a path to the device can be
                        established. An IP address is generally used in order to
                        find a device in a network. <br />
                        There exist two types of IP addresses:
                        <strong>IPv4</strong> and <strong>IPv6</strong>. The
                        latter was defined, because there weren't enough IPv4
                        addresses. <br />
                        <br />
                        An IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits and is usually
                        represented in dot-decimal notation (4 decimal numbers
                        from 0 to 255 separated by dots).

                        An IPv6 address is composed of 128 bits, so it greatly
                        increases the amount of possible addresses (up to
                        2<sup>128</sup>)

                    <h3>Network subnets</h3>
                    <p>
                        They are logical subdivisions of an IP network so that
                        hosts in the same network share identical beginning of
                        their IP addresses. The process of dividing a network
                        into subnets is called <strong>subnetting</strong>.
                        <img

                        <br />
                        This results in the logical division of an IP address
                        into two fields, the network number or routing prefix
                        and the rest field or host identifier. The rest field is
                        an identifier for a specific host or network interface.
                        For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its
                        subnet mask or netmask. They are also expressed in
                        dot-decimal notation like an address. For example,
                        255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask for the prefix
                        198.51.100.0/24. <br />
                        Based on the subnet mask we can derive e.g. the
                        broadcast address. Subnetting may also enhance routing
                        efficiency, or have advantages in network management
                        when subnetworks are administratively controlled by
                        different entities in a larger organization.<br />
                        <br />
                        When several devices are in the same subnetwork, they
                        can communicate without the use of routers. The hosts
                        are identified by their physical addresses.

                    <h3>Network classes</h3>
                    <p>
                        A classful network is a network addressing architecture
                        used in the Internet from 1981 until the introduction of
                        Classless Inter-Domain Routing in 1993. The method
                        divides the IP address space for Internet Protocol
                        version 4 (IPv4) into five address classes based on the
                        leading four address bits. Classes A, B, and C provide
                        unicast addresses for networks of three different
                        network sizes. This architecture extended the addressing
                        capability in the Internet, but did not prevent IP
                        address exhaustion. The problem was that many sites
                        needed larger address blocks than a Class C network
                        provided, and therefore they received a Class B block,
                        which was in most cases much larger than required. In
                        the rapid growth of the Internet, the pool of unassigned
                        Class B addresses was rapidly being depleted.

                    <h3>Network mask</h3>
                    <p>
                        Subnet masks were introduced in response to the
                        ineffective Classful routing (described in the previous
                        point). It allows for grouping big networks into smaller
                        subnetworks where hosts can be more easily identified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is used to distinguish between the subnet address and
                        the host address in an IP address. The mask address must
                        be known to the routers and devices belonging to a
                        subnet. When the router compares a mask address (e.g.
                        255.255.255.0) with an IP address of a host, it gets the
                        information about which part of the address identifies
                        the host, and which one identifies the subnet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example for the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 and the
                        IP address of 192.168.1.25 we can deduce that the host
                        identifier is <strong>25</strong>, as it is comprised of
                        the bits not "covered" by the mask.

                    <h3>Routing table</h3>
                    <p>
                        A routing table, is a set of data collected by a router,
                        which contains routes to network destinations and
                        sometimes their distances (metrics) as well. It has the
                        knowledge of the immediate network topology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data transfer between nodes in a network depends on
                        correct routing of the packets. If a packet cannot be
                        send directly, then a node will pass the IP packet to a
                        gateway in its LAN in order for it to correctly
                        establish a path to the correct destination. The routing
                        table keeps these paths and uses them to determine the
                        correct ones for data packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Routing tables can also contain "next hop" information.
                        They are basically another routers on the packet's way
                        to its final destination. This is called hop-by-hop
                        routing and is the characteristic of the network layer
                        in the OSI model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There exist directly and remotely connected networks.
                        The latter can be reached only by forwarding a data
                        packet to another router through dynamic or static,
                        manually configured routes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A routing table consists of at least 3 fields: <br />
                        Network ID - destination host subnet <br />
                        Metric - Used to determine the shortest path to the
                        gateway <br />
                        Next hop - next router along the way to the packet's
                        destination

                    <h3>Default gateway</h3>
                    <p>
                        A gateway is a network node that serves as an access point to another network, often involving not only a change of addressing, but also a different networking technology. 
                        More narrowly defined, a router forwards packets between networks with different network prefixes. 
                        The networking software stack of each computer contains a routing table that specifies which interface is used for transmission and which router on the network is responsible for forwarding to a specific set of addresses. 
                        If none of these forwarding rules is appropriate for a given destination address, the default gateway is chosen as the router of last resort. 
                        The default gateway is specified by the configuration setting often called default route.
                    </p>
                    <p>Default gateways are typically one of two types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On home or small business networks with a broadband router to share the internet connection, the home router serves as the default gateway.</li>
                        <li>On home or small business networks without a router, such as for residences with dial-up internet access, a router at the internet service provider location serves as the default gateway.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        On Windows default gateway IP address can be accessed through Command Prompt with the use of <code>/ipconfig</code> commnad. On macOS and Linux the <code>netstat</code> and <code>ip route</code> commands are used for finding the default gateway address.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Broadcast</h3>
                    <p>In computer networking, broadcasting refers to transmitting a packet that will be received by every device on the network. 
                        In practice, the scope of the broadcast is limited to a broadcast domain. 
                        For example layer 2 broadcast traffic stays within a local area network (LAN) boundary</p>

                    <h3>Subnet address</h3>
                    <p>
                        A subnet address is the first address in a portion of the 32 bit IP addressing space (subnet) that you can use for your network. 
                        One can also define it as fields of an IP address for which in subnet mask there is bit equal to 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses [(network)(host)]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all "1"s and setting host bits to all "0"s. Within a given network, two host addresses are reserved for special purpose, and cannot be assigned to hosts. 
                        The "0" address is assigned a network address and "255" is assigned to a broadcast address, and they cannot be assigned to hosts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Examples of commonly used netmasks for classed networks are 8-bits (Class A), 16-bits (Class B) and 24-bits (Class C),
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Applying a subnet mask to an IP address separates network address from host address. 
                            The network bits are represented by the 1's in the mask, and the host bits are represented by 0's. 
                            Performing a bitwise logical AND operation on the IP address with the subnet mask produces the network address. 
                            For example, applying the Class C subnet mask to the IP address 216.3.128.12 produces the following network address:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        IP:   1101 1000 . 0000 0011 . 1000 0000 . 0000 1100   (216.003.128.012)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mask: 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 0000 0000   (255.255.255.000)
                    </p>

                    <h3>Private network address</h3>
                    <p>
                            Private IP address is used to assign computers within private space without exsposing them directly to the Internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            A private IP address is the address space allocated by InterNIC to allow organizations to create their own private network. 
                            There are three IP blocks (1 class A, 1 class B and 1 class C) reserved for a private use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            For example, if you have multiple computers within your home you may want to use private IP addresses to address each computer within your home. 
                            In this scenario, router gets the public IP address, and each of the computers, tablets and smartphones connected to the router (via wired or wifi) gets a private IP address from the router via DHCP protocol.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserves the following IP address blocks for use as private IP addresses:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255</li>
                        <li>172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255</li>
                        <li>192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                            The first set of IP addresses from above allow for over 16 million addresses, the second for over 1 million, and over 65,000 for the last range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Another range of private IP addresses is 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255, but those addresses are for Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) use only.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Network address translation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Network address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. 
                        The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. 
                        It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Internet requests that require Network Address Translation (NAT) are quite complex but happen so rapidly that the end user rarely knows it has occurred. 
                        A workstation inside a network makes a request to a computer on the Internet. Routers within the network recognize that the request is not for a resource inside the network, so they send the request to the firewall. 
                        The firewall sees the request from the computer with the internal IP. 
                        It then makes the same request to the Internet using its own public address, and returns the response from the Internet resource to the computer inside the private network. 
                        From the perspective of the resource on the Internet, it is sending information to the address of the firewall. 
                        From the perspective of the workstation, it appears that communication is directly with the site on the Internet. 
                        When NAT is used in this way, all users inside the private network access the Internet have the same public IP address when they use the Internet. 
                        That means only one public addresses is needed for hundreds or even thousands of users.
